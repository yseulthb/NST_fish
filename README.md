# NST_fish
This repository contains the procedure and scripts used to create "styled" fish images using the Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm with the colour preservation implementation [(Gatys et al, 2016)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). 
All images and scripts required to reproduce the stimuli used in [(HÃ©jja-Brichard et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102881) have been uploaded and annotated. 

- Neural Style Transfer algorithm <br>
Choose a couple of images from the [Raw Images] folder (one habitat and one fish image) and give them as input to the NST script.

- Fish animations: <br>
Fish animations were later created with the Blender animation software. Fish were given a path to follow and a video background to render a more naturalistic visual stimulation. Original Blender files and a short tutorial can be found in the folder [Blender files].
