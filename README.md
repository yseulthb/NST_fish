# NST_fish
This repository contains the procedure and scripts used to create "styled" fish images using the Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm with the colour preservation implementation (Gatys et al, 2016). 
All images and scripts required to reproduce the stimuli used in HÃ©jja-Brichard et al. (bioRxiv) have been uploaded and annotated. 

- Neural Style Transfer algorithm <br>
Choose a couple of images from the Raw Images folder (one habitat and one fish image) and give them to the Style Transfer algorithm.
	- Notebook: neural_style_preserve_color.ipynb (to run on Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/)


- Fish animations: <br>
Fish animations were later created with the Blender animation software. Fish were given a path to follow and a video background to render a more naturalistic visual stimulation.
