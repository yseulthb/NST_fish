-- PROCEDURE



1. Open Blender
>> If you have it, open the Blender file in Blender "MotionTrackFish_original (another copy).blend"
and skip steps 2 and 3. 

2. Import the track file (.fdx), this should also bring the original video from which the track was extracted
3. In the Movie clip editor mode, import a second video (the background video) to use it as a reference (it won't be inclduded in the rendering). For faster reading of the video, you can sequence it first (see Motion Tracking 101 tutorial above for the procedure)

4. In the 3D viewpoint mode, click on Add > Image > Image as planes (the add-on for that 3rd option needs to be activated > settings) and select the styled fish image you want to animate
5. Select the fish by clicking on it and modify its rotation coordinates (in the Transform menu) to match the coordinates of the background video (should be something lke X=63.6; Y=0; Z=46.7) and scale it down to a fish size
6. Add a constraint to the fish: Follow Track > untick the Active clip box to select the original movie clip from which the tracking is coming (rather than the background video, should be test_seq); object = camera; track = track. Tick the apply the f-curve option.
7. Take the other model fish and copy the f path to the newly imported fish (be on frame 1!). This will modify the rotation of the fish. Put it back to X=63.6; Y=0; Z=46.7 and left click select "replace keyframes"
8. Object > Apply > Rotation. this should put the value of rotation to 0 and make the current orientation the default one. 
! Don't forget to left clik on 'replace key frame' and to be on frame 1 when you copy paste the new track. this should apply the new rotation to the whole path.

Sun light strength: 1.35 for boulder fish and unstyled fish; O.7 for sand fish 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
>>> Steps below are not necessary but can be useful if you're interested in adding depth to the fish (! It might modify natural statistics!) or if you want to add a separate animation for the fins.

[When selecting the track, the fish rotation will be identical to the track one. We don't want that. Just reorient the fish in the right manner (should be something like: x=-50; Y=-51; Z=-34)]
7. Edit mode > Knife: contour of the fish + of each fin.
8. Face Select: select the background parts and delete > Faces
9. Select all the fins together (shift key to multiselect) > Separate > Selection
10. Back to Object mode: the fish is now made of 2 objects
11. For each fish object, go to constraint and click 'constraint f curve' to allow the copying of the body movement from one fish to the other
12. Import another fdx file (something called movie original.fdx), click on on of the imported fish objects and copy the animation.
13. Paste it to both fish objects (the non imported ones). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. Delete the imported fish object to only render the fish of interest. 
14. Properties > Render properties > Film: tick the Transparent option, to enable the transparent background (otherwise it's gray)
15. Rendering tab > Output: File format = FFmpeg video; container: quicktime; video codec: QT rle/QT animation. This will save the rendered animation as a mov file, keeping the background transparent. 
16. Properties > Output: dont forget to change the name of the animation video or it'll erase the previous one. And you might not want to do that!
17. Render > Render animation: this is quite long. Go have a break or something!
18. When the render has reached the final frame (1250), you can close the render window.
Well done! Your animation has been rendered and is now saved as a video file (.mov)!
